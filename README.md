with China's economic and social development, 
in recent years, people's yearning and pursuit for a better life has gradually upgraded from 
the enjoyment of material life to the concern for life and health. 
The State Council's "healthy China 2030" program points out that it is necessary to adjust and optimize the health service system, 
strengthen early diagnosis, early treatment and early rehabilitation, adhere to the principle of maintaining the basic level, 
strengthening the grass-roots level and building mechanisms, so as to better meet the health needs of the people. 
At the same time, China's population base is huge, but there are few high-quality medical resources, 
and some low-level hospitals do not have some treatment methods. At the same time, clinicians work under great pressure. 
The construction of clinical web system is conducive to reducing the work pressure of clinicians and providing basis for treatment.
Machine learning based on PET / CT / MRI images can provide reference for precision medicine. 
At the same time, in recent years, many studies show that machine learning image classification and recognition can achieve higher accuracy than manual operation. 
At present, there are many cases of using medical images for machine learning, 
such as using MRI images to predict cartilage wear, using deep learning to predict the prognosis of advanced nasopharyngeal 
carcinoma based on PET / CT images. Good results have been obtained.
